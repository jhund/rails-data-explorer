rails-data-explorer
===================

rails-data-explorer is a Rails Engine plugin that makes it easy to explore the
data in your app using charts and statistics.

Make sure to go to the thorough [documentation](http://rails-data-explorer.clearcove.ca)
to find out more!

## IMPORTANT NOTE

This gem is under active development and will see significant changes until it's
officially released.

### Installation

`gem install rails-data-explorer`

or with bundler in your Gemfile:

`gem 'rails-data-explorer'`


### Concepts

* Exploration - top level container
* DataSet - like a spreadsheet with one or more columns of data
* DataSeries - like a column in a spreadsheet, with multiple rows of data
* DataType - Each DataSeries contains data of a certain type.
    * Categorical
    * Quantitative
        * Integer
        * Decimal
        * Temporal
    * Geo
* Chart -


### Ways to shoot yourself in the foot

* Loading too many DB rows at once: Remember that you are loading ActiveRecord
  objects, and they can use a lot of ram. It's a cartesian product of number of
  rows times columns per record. As a rule of thumb, for a medium sized model with
  30 columns, you can load up to 10,000 rows.
* Using expensive operations in the :data_method option for a given data series.
  As a rule of thumb, it should be ok to run simple methods that don't require
  DB access. Examples: `#.to_s`, `if` and `case`, and math operations.
* Declaring too many charts: The charts rendered are the sum of the following:
    * univariate: one or more charts for each data series
    * bivariate: the cartesian product of all data series in a bivariate group
    * multivariate: one or more charts for each multivariate group
  I have tested it with 70 charts on a single page. More are probably ok, I
  just haven't tested it.
