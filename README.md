# rails-data-explorer

Rails-data-explorer is a Rails Engine plugin that makes it easy to explore the
data in your app using charts and statistics.


### Installation

`gem install rails-data-explorer`

or with bundler in your Gemfile:

`gem 'rails-data-explorer'`


### Usage

Let's say you want to explore your app's `User` signup data. Create a route and action
named 'signups' in `app/controllers/users_controller.rb`:

~~~ ruby
def signups
  user_data = User.all.to_a
  c_binner = RailsDataExplorer::Utils::DataBinner.new(
    '0' => 0,
    '1' => 1,
    '2' => 2,
    '3..10' => 10,
    '11..100' => 100,
    '101..1,000' => 1000,
    '1,001..10,000' => 10000
  )
  @rails_data_explorer = RailsDataExplorer.new(
    user_data,
    [
      {
        name: "Session duration [Minutes]",
        data_method: Proc.new { |row|
          ((row.session_duration_minutes * 100).round)/100.0
        },
      },
      {
        name: "Country",
        data_method: Proc.new { |row| row.country },
        multivariate: ['All'],
      },
      {
        name: "Sign in count",
        data_method: Proc.new { |row| c_binner.bin(row.sign_in_count) },
      },
      {
        name: "Language",
        data_method: Proc.new { |row| row.language },
        multivariate: ['All'],
      },
      {
        name: "Plan",
        data_method: Proc.new { |row| row.plan },
        multivariate: ['All'],
      },
      {
        name: "Sign up date",
        data_method: Proc.new { |row| row.created_at },
      },
      {
        name: "Sign up quarter",
        data_method: Proc.new { |row|
          year = row.created_at.year
          quarter = (row.created_at.month / 3.0).ceil
          "#{ year } / Q#{ quarter }"
        },
      },
    ]
  )
end
~~~

Then create a view at `app/views/users/signups.html.erb`:

~~~erb
<div class="rails-data-explorer">
  <h1>User signup data</h1>
  <%= @rails_data_explorer.render %>
</div>
~~~

With just a few lines of code you get comprehensive statistics and charts for your data:

### Ways to shoot yourself in the foot

* **Loading too many DB rows at once**: Remember that you are loading ActiveRecord
  objects, and they can use a lot of ram. It's a cartesian product of number of
  rows times columns per record. As a rule of thumb, for a medium sized model with
  30 columns, you can load up to 10,000 rows.
* **Using expensive operations in the `:data_method` option for a given data series**:
  As a rule of thumb, it should be ok to run simple methods that don't require
  DB access. Examples: `#.to_s`, `if` and `case`, and math operations should all
  be fine.
* **Declaring too many charts**: The charts rendered are the sum of the following:
    * univariate: one or more charts for each data series
    * bivariate: the cartesian product of all data series in a bivariate group
    * multivariate: one or more charts for each multivariate group
  I have tested it with 70 charts on a single page. More are probably ok, I
  just haven't tested it.
* **Drowning in detail**: rails-data-explorer makes it easy to generate a large
  number of charts. Make sure you don't miss the important data in the noise.
