# rails-data-explorer

rails-data-explorer (*RDE*) is a Rails engine plugin that makes it magically
easy to explore your app's data using charts and statistics.

The purpose of *RDE* is to help you develop an intuition for your app's data
so that you can find patterns, correlations and anomalies in the data that
you can then further investigate and exploit.

## Features

* **Optimized for simplicity and convenience**: All you have to do is provide
  your data in tabular form. *RDE* then decides how to best visualize and
  present your data.
* **Batteries included**: *RDE* includes everything required to render stunning
  charts and visualizations. It is tightly integrated with Rails and doesn't
  require knowledge of charting libraries, statistics, or data engineering.
* **Comprehensive data visualization and analysis**: Out of the box *RDE*
  gives you univariate charts and statistics for each column of your data. It
  also gives you single click access to all bivariate combinations
  of your data columns. With a single config param, it will even generate
  arbitrary multivariate charts for you.
* **Works with small- and medium-sized data**: *RDE* works great for up to ~100K records.
  I'm thinking about ways to make it work for larger data series using sampling.
  If you know how to do this correctly in ActiveRecord, please let me know.

Detailed features

* Integrates with ActiveRecord.
* Renders beautiful charts (using Vega/Nvd3 and d3.js).
* Uses best charting practices (using Vega visualization grammar).
* Automatically detects and handles categorical and quantitative data types.
  (integer, decimal, and temporal)
* Automatically renders visualizations and statistics for univariate, bivariate
  and multivariate analysis.
* Provides single click access to univarate and all possible combinations of
  bivariate analyses.
* Automatically picks linear vs. logarithmic axes.
* Automatically finds top N values for categorical data to make charts easier
  to read.
* Automatically sorts axis labels for maximum clarity.
* Performs Pearson's Chi squared test on bivariate analysis of categorical data.
  This is super useful when analyzing and interpreting A/B test data, or to find
  correlations in your data.
* Works well with the Filterrific gem for filtering data before it is fed to
  *RDE*.
* Provides statistical utility methods, e.g., to bin or quantize your data.

*RDE* provides the following chart types:

* Bar chart (simple, stacked, percent distribution)
* Pie chart
* Histogram
* Box plot (single and group)
* Scatterplot
* Parallel coordinates
* Parallel set
* Contingency table with pearson's chi squared test (good to interpret A/B test data)



## Installation

`gem install rails-data-explorer`

or with bundler in your Gemfile:

`gem 'rails-data-explorer'`



## Usage

Let's say you want to explore your app's `User` signup data. Create a route and
action for `users#signups`:

~~~ ruby
# app/controllers/users_controller.rb

def signups
  c_binner = RailsDataExplorer::Utils::DataBinner.new(
    '0' => 0,
    '1' => 1,
    '2' => 2,
    '3..10' => 10,
    '11..100' => 100,
    '101..1,000' => 1000,
    '1,001..10,000' => 10000
  )
  @rde = RailsDataExplorer.new(
    User.all.to_a, # DANGER! Make sure not to load too much data into memory!
    [
      {
        name: "Session duration [Minutes]",
        data_method: Proc.new { |row|
          ((row.session_duration_minutes * 100).round)/100.0
        },
      },
      {
        name: "Country",
        data_method: Proc.new { |row| row.country },
      },
      {
        name: "Sign in count",
        data_method: Proc.new { |row| c_binner.bin(row.sign_in_count) },
      },
      {
        name: "Language",
        data_method: Proc.new { |row| row.language },
      },
      {
        name: "Plan",
        data_method: Proc.new { |row| row.plan },
      },
      {
        name: "Sign up date",
        data_method: Proc.new { |row| row.created_at },
      },
      {
        name: "Sign up quarter",
        data_method: Proc.new { |row|
          year = row.created_at.year
          quarter = (row.created_at.month / 3.0).ceil
          "#{ year } / Q#{ quarter }"
        },
      },
    ],
    params[:rde]
  )
end
~~~

Then create a view at `app/views/users/signups.html.erb`:

~~~erb
<div class="rails-data-explorer">
  <h1>User signup data</h1>
  <%= rails_data_explorer(@rde) %>
</div>
~~~

With just a few lines of code you get comprehensive statistics and charts for
your data (see screenshots above).



## Ways to shoot yourself in the foot

* **Loading too many DB rows at once**: Remember that you are loading ActiveRecord
  objects, and they can use a lot of ram. It's a cartesian product of number of
  rows times columns per record. As a rule of thumb, for a medium sized model with
  10 columns, you can load up to ~100K rows. Strategies to mitigate memory bloat:
    * Use `find_each` to build up a plain old Array with data just from the columns you are interested in.
    * Use `select` to limit the number of columns to fetch from the database.
    * Sample your database. I'm currently investigating ways to do this efficiently.
* **Using expensive operations in the `:data_method` option for a given data series**:
  Make sure to only use super simple operations like `#.to_s`, `if`, and math operations. Avoid the following:
    * DB queries.
    * Recursive methods (e.g., `deep_symbolize_keys`).
    * Access 3rd party services and APIs.
    * Instantiate common objects in each iteration. Instead instantiate them once outside of the loop and refer to a singleton object.
* **Drowning in detail**: rails-data-explorer makes it easy to generate a large
  number of charts. Make sure you don't miss the important data in the noise.
